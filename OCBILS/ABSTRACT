Old, climatically buffered, infertile landscapes (Ocbils) have been hypothesized to harbor an elevated number of persistent plant lineages and are predicted to occur 
across different parts of the globe, interspersed with other types of landscape.  We tested whether the mean age of a plant community is associated with occurrence on 
Ocbils, as predicted by climatic stability and poor soil environments. Using digitized occurrence data for seed plants occurring in Australia (15,029 species), southern 
Africa (16,802 species), and South America (31,313 species), regions that comprise commonly investigated Ocbils (Southwestern Australian Floristic Region, Greater Cape 
Floristic Region, and campos rupestres), and phylogenies pruned to match the species occurrences, we tested for associations between environmental data (current-day 
climate, soil composition, elevation, and climatic stability) and two novel metrics developed here that capture the age of a community (Mean Tip Length and Mean Node 
Height). Our results indicate plant community ages are influenced by a combination of multiple environmental predictors that vary globally; we did not find 
statistically strong associations between the environments of Ocbil areas and community age, in contrast to the prediction for these landscapes. The Cape Floristic 
Region was the only Ocbil showing a significant, although not strong, overlap with old communities.
